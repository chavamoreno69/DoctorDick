    question: "What’s Doctor Dick? ",
    answer: "Doctor Dick is a tool that gay guys can use to stay on top of their sexual health. Doctor Dick can gay guys  know which HIV and/or STD tests they need, which vaccinations related to sexual health they need, and whether they should consider PrEP.  "
  },

  {
    question: "Who is Doctor Dick meant for?",
    answer: "Doctor Dick is meant for all guys who have sex with other guys. "
  },

  {
    question: "How much does Doctor Dick cost?",
    answer: "Nothing! You can use Doctor Dick for free. "
  },

  {
    question: "When should someone use Doctor Dick?",
    answer: "Use Doctor Dick when you’re feeling healthy, in order to know how you can best stay that way. Doctor Dick can help you know when you should get tested, when to get vaccinations for sexual health, and whether you should consider PrEP. "
  },

  {
    question: "When should someone *not* use Doctor Dick?",
    answer: "If you have any symptoms of disease, don’t use Doctor Dick. Seek medical help immediately, either by calling your doctor, or – if it’s an emergency – going to the emergency room or calling 911. Symptoms of disease include discharge from your penis, pain with urination, sore throat, rectal pain, fever, chills, or rash. "
  },

  {
    question: "Why can’t I just ask my doctor to give me what I need?",
    answer: "You can – and you should! As you might know, some health recommendations for gay guys are different than for straight guys or women. But often gay guys, even if they know that, don’t know exactly what the recommendations are. Unfortunately, sometimes their doctors don’t either. Doctors sometimes don’t take the time or have the comfort, knowledge, or experience to know about the sexual health needs for gay men. That’s where Doctor Dick can help – by empowering you to know what’s specifically recommended for you, where you can get it, and when you next need it."
  },

  {
    question: "How does Doctor Dick know what to ask and which recommendations to make?",
    answer: "Doctor Dick uses guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies to know which questions to ask and which recommendations to make. Our team, with the help of our medical advisory board, continually reviews both the questions Doctor Dick asks and the recommendations that Doctor Dick makes."
  },

  {
    question: "How does it work?",
    answer: "Doctor Dick asks you questions about your medical history and sexual behaviors. Using that information, Doctor Dick provides customized recommendations related to sexual health in four areas: HIV testing, sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, vaccinations for sexual health, and PrEP. Doctor Dick also allows you to search for clinics where you can get the sexual health services you need. Finally, Doctor Dick allows you to set reminders, so that you remember when next to go back for tests, vaccinations for sexual health, or other services. "
  },

  {
    question: "What’s PrEP?",
    answer: "PrEP is a way for HIV-negative guys to prevent getting HIV. It involves taking one pill per day. Condom use is still recommended to reduce risk of getting HIV and other STDs."
  },

  {
    question: "Why are there four different areas that Doctor Dick asks about? ",
    answer: "There are four different areas — HIV testing, STD testing, vaccinations for sexual health, and PrEP — because recommendations in these areas are different for gay men. Some don’t apply to all guys, but you might not know until you answer some questions. Be sure to go through all four areas."
  },

  {
    question: "Will Doctor Dick tell me everything I need to know about my health?",
    answer: "No. Doctor Dick is focused on sexual health — specifically, HIV testing, STD testing, vaccinations for sexual health, and PrEP. Doctor Dick doesn’t cover other aspects of health, like getting your blood pressure or cholesterol checked, getting a colonoscopy, or other health issues that aren’t related to sexual health. Like everyone else, gay guys have health needs that go beyond sexual health. Ask your doctor not only about your sexual health needs but about your general health needs too. "
  },

  {
    question: "Does it matter if I answer Doctor Dick’s questions truthfully?",
    answer: "Yes, it does. It’s important to answer all of the questions truthfully. If you don’t answer truthfully, Doctor Dick won’t be able to provide reliable recommendations. And that’s not good for your health!"
  },

  {
    question: "How does Doctor Dick protect my personal information?",
    answer: "The Personal Information (including your HIV testing history and survey responses) that you enter into our system is not protected by HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996). HIPAA protects health information held by or on behalf of your health care provider or health plan. Doctor Dick, however, does not store your Personal Information. While we are very concerned with safeguarding your information and employ reasonable measures to do that, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security."
  },

  {
    question: "Can I use Doctor Dick on my other mobile phones, or on other devices linked to my phone?",
    answer: "No. All information provided to Doctor Dick stays on the device on which you installed Doctor Dick. You will not be able to access your account information on multiple devices. In the event you change mobile phones or reinstall the application on your device, you will not be able to recover your information, since we do not store your data."
